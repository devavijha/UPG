## ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Run the SQL Schema

### Method 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/wssduhfpwwfhplgmtaey/sql/new

2. **Open the SQL file**:
   - Open `supabase-schema.sql` in your project root
   - Copy ALL the content (Cmd+A, Cmd+C)

3. **Run the SQL**:
   - Paste it in the Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"** (or Cmd+Enter)
   - Wait for "Success" message

4. **Verify Tables Created**:
   - Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/wssduhfpwwfhplgmtaey/editor
   - You should see these tables:
     - profiles
     - products
     - donations
     - cart_items
     - wishlist
     - orders
     - order_items

## ðŸ“¦ Step 2: Create Storage Bucket for Images

1. **Go to Storage**:
   - https://app.supabase.com/project/wssduhfpwwfhplgmtaey/storage/buckets

2. **Create New Bucket**:
   - Click **"New bucket"**
   - Name: `product-images`
   - **Public bucket**: Toggle ON âœ…
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

3. **Set Storage Policies**:
   - Click on the `product-images` bucket
   - Go to **"Policies"** tab
   - Click **"New Policy"**
   
   **Policy 1: Public Read**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Public Access"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');
   ```
   
   **Policy 2: Authenticated Upload**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (
     bucket_id = 'product-images' 
     AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
   );
   ```
   
   **Policy 3: Users Delete Own**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own images"
   ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
   USING (
     bucket_id = 'product-images' 
     AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
   );
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Step 3: Test the Connection

Run this command from your project:

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser console and test:

```javascript
// In browser console
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('products').select('*')
console.log('Products:', data)
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**Error: "relation 'public.profiles' does not exist"**
- You haven't run the SQL schema yet
- Go to SQL Editor and run `supabase-schema.sql`

**Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"**
- RLS is enabled but policies aren't set
- Re-run the SQL schema (it includes DROP POLICY IF EXISTS)

**Images won't upload**
- Check storage bucket exists and is public
- Verify storage policies are set
- Check browser console for errors
